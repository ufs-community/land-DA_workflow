   ATM
      The Weather Model configuration that runs only the standalone atmospheric model. 

   CCPP
      The `Common Community Physics Package <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp>`_ is a forecast-model agnostic, vetted collection of code containing atmospheric physical parameterizations and suites of parameterizations for use in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) along with a framework that connects the physics to the host forecast model.

   CDEPS
      The `Community Data Models for Earth Predictive Systems <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/CDEPS/>`_ repository (CDEPS) contains a set of :term:`NUOPC`-compliant data components and :term:`ESMF`-based "stream" code that selectively removes feedback in coupled model systems. In essence, CDEPS handles the static Data Atmosphere (:term:`DATM`) integration with dynamic coupled model components (e.g., :term:`MOM6`). The CDEPS data models perform the basic function of reading external data files, modifying those data, and then sending the data back to the :term:`CMEPS` mediator. The fields sent to the :term:`mediator` are the same as those that would be sent by an active component. This takes advantage of the fact that the mediator and other CMEPS-compliant model components have no fundamental knowledge of whether another component is fully active or just a data component. More information about DATM is available in the CDEPS `Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/versions/master/html/index.html>`_.

   CESM
      The `Community Earth System Model <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/>`_ (CESM) is a fully-coupled global climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (:term:`NCAR`) in collaboration with colleagues in the research community. 

   CMEPS
      The `Community Mediator for Earth Prediction Systems <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/CMEPS>`_ (CMEPS) is a :term:`NUOPC`-compliant :term:`mediator` used for coupling Earth system model components. It is currently being used in NCAR's Community Earth System Model (:term:`CESM`) and NOAA's subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) coupled system. More information is available in the `CMEPS Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CMEPS/versions/master/html/index.html>`_.

   container
      `Docker <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_ describes a container as "a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another."

   cron
   cron job
   crontab
   cron table
      Cron is a job scheduler accessed through the command-line on UNIX-like operating systems. It is useful for automating tasks such as regression testing. Cron periodically checks a cron table (aka crontab) to see if any tasks are are ready to execute. If so, it runs them. 

   cycle
      An hour of the day on which a forecast is started. In the Land DA System, it usually follows YYYYMMDD-HHmmss format. 

   data assimilation
      One of the major sources of error in weather and climate forecasts is uncertainty related to the initial conditions that are used to generate future predictions. Even the most precise instruments have a small range of unavoidable measurement error, which means that tiny measurement errors (e.g., related to atmospheric conditions and instrument location) can compound over time. These small differences result in very similar forecasts in the short term (i.e., minutes, hours), but they cause widely divergent forecasts in the long term. Errors in weather and climate forecasts can also arise because models are imperfect representations of reality. Data assimilation systems seek to mitigate these problems by combining the most timely observational data with a "first guess" of the atmospheric state (usually a previous forecast) and other sources of data to provide a "best guess" analysis of the atmospheric state to start a weather or climate simulation. When combined with an "ensemble" of model runs (many forecasts with slightly different conditions), data assimilation helps predict a range of possible atmospheric states, giving an overall measure of uncertainty in a given forecast. 
   
   DATM
      DATM is the *Data Atmosphere* component of :term:`CDEPS`. It uses static atmospheric forcing files (derived from observations or previous atmospheric model runs) instead of output from an active atmospheric model. This reduces the complexity and computational cost associated with coupling to an active atmospheric model. The *Data Atmosphere* component is particularly useful when employing computationally intensive Data Assimilation (DA) techniques to update ocean and/or sea ice fields in a coupled model. In general, use of DATM in place of :term:`ATM` can be appropriate when users are running a coupled model and only want certain components of the model to be active. More information about DATM is available in the `CDEPS Documentation <https://escomp.github.io/CDEPS/versions/master/html/datm.html>`_.

   ERA5
      The ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (`ERA5 <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5>`_) dataset "is the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present." It "provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables."

   forcing data
      In coupled mode, data that are generated by one component of a model can be fed into another component to provide required input describing the state of the Earth system. When models are run in offline, or "uncoupled" mode, the model does not receive this input from another active component, so "forcing" files are provided. These files may consist of observational data or data gathered when running other components separately, and they contain values for the required input fields. 

   FV3

Developed at NOAA’s `Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory <https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/>`__ (GFDL), it is a scalable and flexible dycore capable of both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic atmospheric simulations. It is the dycore used in the UFS Weather Model.
